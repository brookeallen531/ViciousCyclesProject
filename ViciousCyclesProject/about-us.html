        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h3>Who is Vicious Cycles?</h3>
        <p>Vicious Cycles Inc is a Sarasota-based cycle workshop founded by a few like-minded individuals in late 2010. Our mechanics build the bikes and man the workshop. Our customer service staff attends to the day to day operations. We hope to create
            and foster a strong passion for the local biking scene because each and every one of us is a biking enthusiast.
            <br><br> We believe that every machine should be an extension of its owner. We believe in the significance of individualism. We believe in the stories between your cycle and you. We believe in having fun. No matter the circumstances, we bike
            hard and we bike often. <br><br> You get on your bike, you ride, you fall, you might get pulled over, you overcome it all and you ride again. Itâ€™s a Vicious Cycle! So make it worth the while, don't just be part of the numbers. Ride your cycle,
            chase your dreams, live your life.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How Can I Buy From Vicious Cycles?</h3>
        <p> Vicious Cycle products can be purchased/ordered at our store. Come down today and we'll get started with a purchase of an existing bike with cash, credit, or an in-house loan approval. All custom builds will require a 25% down payment before projects
            will begin, and either payment in full, or an approved in-house loan or a transfer of funds to a third-party vendor. All purchases on custom cycles are final.</p>
